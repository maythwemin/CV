        <em>Aspiring UI/UX Front-End Web Developer</em>

      <br>
      <p>
        I graduated from Yale-NUS College as a Psychology Major in 2020 (<em>not a great year, I know...</em>).
        I am currently working as marketing executive in TaF.tc but taking on more UI/UX and web development projects
        whenever I can! I love design, and learning about code, so web development, which involves the creation of
        beautiful designs through code, appeals very much to me!
